## What is this?
This website is the product of a tutorial that I followed on how to make a simple site with the Flask framework. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI&t=7139s&ab_channel=TechWithTim

## How to use it
Download all files in the same directory and run "main".

## How it works
Flask uses a combination of HTML, Python, CSS, JS and SQLAlchemy to make it work.

-HTML frontend

-CSS bootstrap templates to make things look nice

-JS for functionality

-SQLAlchemy for the database

-Python for the backend. Python can be written directly into the pages with Jinja.
